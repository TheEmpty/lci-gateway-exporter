# LCI Gateway Exporter

Currently only exports Generator, HVAC, and Tanks.
Makes a great companion to something like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana.](https://grafana.com/)
Allowing you to create alarms for things HVAC temprature, tank level, or genrator run time.
This must be run on the same network as your LCI gateway. Eg, you should be able to see a JSON response [from the gateway.](http://192.168.1.4:8080/rest/things/)

**Disclaimer:** Not officaily supported. Developer(s) not associated with the LCI brand or company.

## Docker Image
Quick start: `docker run -p 8888:8888 theempty/lci-gateway-exporter:latest`

Currently no supported configurable settings.

## Example Dashboards
### HVAC
Note: Battery percentage and charging status is coming from Victron.
